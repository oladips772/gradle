Welcome to Gradle 7.5.1!
Here are the highlights of this release:
 - Support for Java 18
 - Support for building with Groovy 4
- Much more responsive continuous builds
- Improved diagnostics for dependency resolution
For more details see https://docs.gradle.org/7.5.1/release-notes.html
To honour the JVM settings for this build a single-use Daemon process will be forked. See https://docs.gradle.org/7.5.1/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:disabling_the_daemon.
Daemon will be stopped at the end of the build

The Kotlin Gradle plugin was loaded multiple times in different subprojects, which is not supported and may break the build. 
This might happen in subprojects that apply the Kotlin plugins with the Gradle 'plugins { ... }' DSL if they specify explicit versions, even if the versions are equal.
Please add the Kotlin plugin to the common parent project or the root project, then remove the versions in the subprojects.
If the parent project does not need the plugin, add 'apply false' to the plugin line.
See: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:subprojects_plugins_dsl

WARNING: [Processor] Library '/home/expo/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/com.google.android.exoplayer/exoplayer-ui/2.18.1/eed81d49b8b0e9a365cbec260dafb222d6e5bc67/exoplayer-ui-2.18.1.aar' contains references to both AndroidX and old support library. This seems like the library is partially migrated. Jetifier will try to rewrite the library anyway.
